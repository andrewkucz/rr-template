# Shadcn Admin Template (the remix)

Adapted from: https://github.com/satnaing/shadcn-admin

- Tanstack Router -> React Router v7
- Clerk -> Better Auth
- ESLint + Prettier -> Biome
- + TRPC
- + DrizzleORM (Postgres)

## Stack

- React Router
- Shadcn UI
  - Tailwind CSS
  - Radix UI
- Drizzle ORM
  - Postgres
- Better Auth
- tRPC
  - React Query 

Also included:

- [biome](https://biomejs.dev/guides/getting-started/) | formatting and linting
- [nuqs](https://nuqs.dev/) | url query param management
- [@tanstack/table](https://tanstack.com/table/latest) | headless table ui
- [@daveyplate/better-auth-tanstack](https://github.com/daveyplate/better-auth-tanstack) | better-auth + @tanstack/react-query helpers

## Dev

To run dev database locally:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d

# generate migration and apply
npm run db:generate && npm run db:migrate

# OR: push schema right to db
npx drizzle-kit push
```

## Info

Note: Better auth is setup and configured with email and password auth. The template has been configured so that the main dashboard is gated behind authentication. To change this behavior update the `loader` method in `app/routes/_authenticated.tsx`

## Customization

Generate favicon and icon assets using [RealFaviconGenerator.net](https://realfavicongenerator.net/). Go through wizard, generate zip file of assets and extract contents to `./public`

Template is already configured to use these assets in `app/root.tsx`

# Possible Todo
- Proper deployment setup + working demo
- Beautify README, add example images etc.
- 1 central configuration for site name, description, etc
